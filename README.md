# **EQLE** - Daily Equation Puzzle Game

## EQLE is a Swift-based iOS app where players solve a daily 8-character mathematical equation in up to six tries, similar to Wordle but for math puzzles. Built with SwiftUI, it features a dark-mode UI, streak tracking, and a single daily attempt restriction.

### Features

- Daily Puzzle: Solve one unique equation per day (e.g., "12+57=69").

- Feedback System: Tiles turn green (correct position), yellow (wrong position), or red (not in solution).

- Toast Notification: Displays "You already completed your daily puzzle! Come back tomorrow." if you try to play again.

- Endgame Screen: Shows "Solved in X tries" on win or "Good Try..." on loss.

- Stats Tracking: Tracks total games played, wins, win distribution, and streaks.
